Dear Sir or madam,
On April 8, 2017, I lost my credit card while I was abroad. Please find below the credit card's details:
Card Type: American Express 4242 8978 2056 4987, Expiration date 09/2019, CVV 987.
As soon as I realized the card was lost, I phoned the company and asked that it be cancelled.
This letter is to request that you issue me a replacement card as soon as possible. The cancelled card should be not authorized under any circumstances.
Thank you for your attention.
If you have any questions, I can be reached at the phone number or email above mentioned
Sincerely,
Anne Cuthbert
